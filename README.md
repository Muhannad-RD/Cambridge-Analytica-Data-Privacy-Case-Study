# Case Study: Data Privacy Failures in the Cambridge Analytica Scandal

## Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the **Cambridge Analytica & Facebook** data breach, one of the most significant privacy incidents in modern history. The study evaluates the incident through the lens of data governance, stewardship, and legal compliance, comparing international standards with local regulations.

## Analysis Framework
The report analyzes the failure from three critical perspectives:

* **Data Governance:** Lack of accountability, poor third-party data management, and inadequate risk assessment.
* **Data Stewardship & Quality:** Failures in maintaining data integrity and the ethical harvesting of user profiles.
* **Privacy & Legal Compliance:** A detailed comparison of how this incident violated:
    * **GDPR** (General Data Protection Regulation - EU).
    * **PDPL** (Personal Data Protection Law - Saudi Arabia).

## Key Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the project outlines several strategic measures to prevent similar breaches:

1.  Implementation of **Privacy by Design (PbD)**.
2.  Conducting regular **Privacy Impact Assessments (PIA)**.
3.  Establishing a dedicated **Privacy Office** led by a Data Protection Officer (DPO).
